Sourcebans.lua-with-ULX
=======================

I made a new repo for Sourcebans.lua, since I also added ULIB/ULX Support.

##Installation (Windows)

- Copy the folders/files in the garrysmod folder into your installation of garrysmod Dedicated Server.
- Modify "lua/autorun/server/sourcebans_cfg.lua", enter in your SourceBans info.
- Restart Server

##Installation (Linux)

- You will need to find a Linux version of MySQLOO. (I coudn't find one)
- After you have found one for Linux, contact me, so I can add it here.
- Install the Linux Version of Gmod MySQLOO (If you found one)
- Follow instructions for the Windows installation.
- Delete the Windows .dll's.
